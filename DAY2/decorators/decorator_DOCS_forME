python support function closure property which means: that inner function defined  in a non-global scope remember what their enclosing namespace was looked  like at defination time.
EXAMPLE:
def outer(x):
    print "inside outer", x
    def inner():
    	print "inside inner", x
    return inner

foo= outer('z') 
foo()
outer(1)
foo()
foo.func_closure
